## 🖱️ MOUSE EFFECTS INCONSISTENCIES TO FIX

### Current Mouse Effect Components:
1. **CustomCursor.tsx** - Main cursor component (✅ working)
2. **ServiceMouseFollower.tsx** - Services section specific (needs integration)
3. **InteractiveFeatures.tsx** - General hover effects

### Inconsistent Hover Effects Found:
- **CSS hover states** on buttons vary (some scale, some just color change)
- **Service section** has its own mouse follower vs global cursor
- **Case study items** have different hover animations
- **Navigation buttons** vs **CTA buttons** have different behaviors
- **Form elements** have inconsistent hover states

### Standardization Needed:
```css
/* All buttons should follow this pattern */
.standard-button:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

/* All interactive elements should use consistent cursor states */
.interactive:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### Mouse Effects Standardization:
1. **Unify all hover effects** to use the same scale/transition values
2. **Remove ServiceMouseFollower** and integrate into main CustomCursor
3. **Standardize all button hover states** across the site
4. **Make sure cursor changes consistently** for all interactive elements

## 🔄 MOUSE EFFECTS QUICK FIX PLAN

I can help you standardize the mouse effects by:
1. Creating a unified hover class system
2. Updating all buttons to use consistent animations
3. Removing duplicate mouse follower components
4. Making sure CustomCursor handles all interactions

Would you like me to tackle the mouse effects standardization now, or would you prefer to focus on content first and handle the technical polish later?
